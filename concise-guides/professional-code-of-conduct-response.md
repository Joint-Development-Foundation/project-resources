## JDF Concise Guide to Professional Code of Conduct Response

The Joint Development Foundation’s Membership Agreement includes a code of conduct clause in Section 15 of the Project Charter:

> _15. Code of Conduct._ The Project has adopted the terms of the Contributor Covenant 1.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct/). To report an issue or concern under this Code of Conduct, contact the Project Chairperson or the Joint Development Foundation General Manager.

The Contributor Covenant states that the Project can remove, edit, or reject comments, contributions, and persons that do not follow the Code of Conduct. However, it does not provide guidance beyond reporting issues to a Project leader or designated party. The guidelines below are intended to assist JDF Project Series in the event that a Conduct issue has been formally raised in the course of the project’s day-to-day work. If you receive a Conduct complaint:

1. **DO notify conduct@jointdevelopment.org with the conduct complaint.** The persons on this email alias are trained on Code of Conduct enforcement and have the necessary legal background to process complaints. The current recipients of emails to this address are: Jory Burson, Joanna Lee, and Mike Dolan.
2. **DO remove harmful content promptly from Project workspaces.** Moderation tools available on GitHub and similar platforms can remove harmful content while also keeping a record of the moderation activity, which may be helpful if the complaint is part of a pattern. If the system at issue does not retain a record, please retain documentation of the harmful content (e.g. a timestamped screenshot) in case it is needed later. 
3. **DON’T investigate the complaint on your own or by committee.** Other than removing harmful content from Project workspaces, do not attempt to investigate potential violations or enforce the Code of Conduct on your own; if you learn of an incident that has not already been reported, please promptly notify [conduct@jointdevelopment.org](mailto:conduct@jointdevelopment.org)*.    
4. **DO share factual information and evidence with the notifications group.** This includes screenshots, meeting information, and links in addition to the substance of the complaint and what happened. Please remember to stick to the facts.
5. **DON’T broadcast the complaint to others.** Widely sharing a conduct complaint can escalate the issue or spark other negative behaviors (such as [brigading](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/brigading/)). 
6. **DO report issues as soon as possible.**

If the complaint arises in the course of an in-person event such as a meeting or conference, the event’s Code of Conduct policy guidelines will apply. The Event Code of Conduct for JDF Project Series events can be found at [https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/)

_Emails to conduct@jointdevelopment.org are sent to the JDF Series Manager, the JDF General Manager, and LF's CoC Counsel._
